        <h3>Most Popular Tourist Destinations in East Africa</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="mara">
        <h3><b> 1. Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya</b></h3>
        <img src="image/mara.jpg">
        <p>Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve has earned itself a reputation
            <br> as one of Africa's most rewarding safari destinations,
            <br> and for good reason. Regardless of the time of year,
            <br> wildlife sightings are both plentiful and diverse.
            <br> It's possible to see the Big Five in a single day,
            <br> and during the July-November dry season, the plains
            <br> are filled with the vast herds of the annual wildebeest migration.
            <br> In particular, watching the herds crossing the Mara River in their
            <br> thousands is a spectacle few will ever forget. Cultural visits to
            <br> traditional Maasai villages are another highlight of this spectacular East African reserve.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="omo">
        <h3><b>2. Omo River Region, Ethiopia</b></h3>
        <img src="image/omo.jpg">
        <p>Part of Africa's incredible Great Rift Valley,
            <br> the Omo River Region is perhaps one of the most remote destinations in East Africa.
            <br> However, those that are willing to make the long and difficult trip to get there will be rewarded
            <br> with incredible scenery, and the chance to visit villages that have remained unchanged for hundreds
            <br> of years. There are many different tribes in this part of Ethiopia, and each one has its own
            <br> traditional dress, culture and ceremonies. In order to get the most out of your Omo River experience,
            <br> it is advisable to join a tour, some of which combine cultural visits with white-water rafting on
            <br> the region's famous rapids.</p>

    <div class="vol">
        <h3><b>3. Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda</b></h3>
        <img src="image/volc.jpg">
        <p>Draped in mist and full of lush vegetation,
            <br> Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park nestles deep within the Virunga Mountains
            <br>. As Africa's oldest national park, it is one of the best places in the world to encounter
            <br> the critically endangered mountain gorilla. A subspecies of the wider-ranging eastern gorilla,
            <br> there are only around 800 of these amazing animals left. To share a moment with them in their
            <br> natural environment is an intensely moving experience and one that should be at the top of
            <br> any wildlife lover's bucket list. The park provides a home for several other rare species,
            <br> including 29 endemic species of bird.</p>

    <div class="ser">
        <h3><b>4. Serengeti National Park, Tanzania</b></h3>
        <img src="image/download.jpg">
        <p>Those in search of the ultimate safari experience should consider combining
            <br> a trip to the Maasai Mara with a visit to Serengeti National Park in neighboring Tanzania.
            <br> Here, breathtaking open plains are dotted with acacia trees and grazing game.
            <br> It's a great place to spot predators like lion and cheetah in action;
            <br> especially during the January-March rainy season. At this time,
            <br> wildebeest descend upon the southern Serengeti to give birth,
            <br> and the newborn calves make easy prey for hungry cats.
            <br> In April, the herds start their migration to the Maasai Mara,
            <br> but the game-viewing remains exceptional all year round.</p>

    <div class="wat">
        <h3><b>5. Watamu, Kenya</b></h3>
        <img src="image/watamu.jpg">
        <p>Unlike many of Kenya's other beach towns,
            <br> Watamu is still considered an enclave of peace and quiet.
            <br> Located slap bang in the middle of Kenya's exquisite coastline,
            <br> Watamu is small, relaxed and full of history. It is best known for its stunning
            <br> bays and palm-fringed beaches, and for its prolific coral reefs.
            <br> Deep-sea fishing is a favorite pastime here, and several dive schools offer
            <br> the chance to take up scuba diving. On land, beachfront restaurants serve fresh seafood,
            <br> Mida Creek boasts stunning birdlife, and Gedi Ruins offers an insight into the life of the
            <br> 13th Century Swahili people.</p>

        <h3><b>6. Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania</b></h3>
        <img src="image/ngoro.jpg">
        <p>Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area is dominated by the ancient Ngorongoro Crater.
            <br> Approximately 1,970 feet/ 600 meters deep, the crater is the world's largest intact caldera,
            <br> and one of East Africa's most incredible natural spectacles.
            <br> Within its rim, countless animals range across the grassy plains of the crater floor,
            <br> including a significant population of critically endangered black rhino and some of
            <br> the largest remaining tusker elephants. Black-maned lions are another impressive sight,
            <br> as are the flocks of flamingo that appear on the crater's soda lake during the breeding season.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="kili">
        <h3><b>7.Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania</b></h3>
        <img src="image/kilim.jpg">
        <p>Perhaps one of the continent's most iconic sights,
            <br> Mount Kilimanjaro stands in perfect isolation against the foreground of the African savannah.
            <br> At 19,340 feet/5,895 meters, it is the tallest peak in Africa and the world's highest free-standing mountain.
            <br> Those with a reasonable level of fitness and a keen sense of adventure should consider
            <br> making the climb for the ultimate Kilimanjaro experience.
            <br> Climbing with a guide is compulsory, and allowing a few extra days to â€‹acclimatize to
            <br> the altitude is advised. Depending on your route, the climb takes five to nine days.
            <br> If you're short on time, consider climbing nearby Mount Meru instead.</p>

    <div class="ethf">
        <h3><b>8.Lalibela, Ethiopia</b></h3>
        <img src="image/eth.jpg">
        <p>Located in the heart of Ethiopia's northern highlands,
            <br> Lalibela is a historic town of great religious importance for the country's Orthodox Christians.
            <br> In the 12th Century, it was designed as a 'New Jerusalem';
            <br> an alternative for pilgrims who were prevented from traveling to the Holy Land by conflict.
            <br> Today, its magnificent rock-hewn churches attract visitors from all over the world.
            <br> There are 11 of these monolithic churches, each one carved from the rock face.
            <br> One of them, Biete Medhani Alem, is believed to be the largest monolithic church in the world,
            <br> and all of them are a testament to the devotion of their creators.</p>

    <div class="nkr">
        <h3><b>9. Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya</b></h3>
        <img src="image/nkrt.jpg">
        <p>The highlight of this Rift Valley park is the eponymous Lake Nakuru,
            <br> a soda lake famous for its incredible flamingo population.
            <br> The density of the flamingo flock depends on the time of year.
            <br> During the dry season, water levels fall and the lake becomes more alkaline,
            <br> generating more algae for the birds to feed on. At this time,
            <br> numbers of lesser and greater flamingo can swell to as many as two million birds,
            <br> creating a rose-hued haze across the lake's surface.
            <br> The park itself is home to a host of other animals,
             including lions, rhino and approximately 450 species of bird.</p>
